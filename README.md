Doors in minecraft are kind of ugly. Their models are flat and boring, their textures look weird in some places and they don't even rotate correctly! How unprofessional.

That's why this pack exists! It aims to fix these issues and give doors fancy additions such as:

> Proper rotations

> Custom, fully 3D models for each door

> Items that use same models as the blocks

> Custom textures for the sides

> Revamped iron and oak door textures
