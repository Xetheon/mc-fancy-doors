Doors in minecraft are kind of ugly. Their models are flat and boring, their textures look weird in some places and they don't even rotate correctly! How unprofessional.

That's why this pack exists! It aims to fix these issues and give doors fancy additions such as:

- Proper rotations
- Custom, fully 3D models for each door
- Items that use same models as the blocks
- Custom textures for the sides
- Revamped iron and oak door textures


## Install

#### Find your resourcepacks folder

The quickest and easiest way to do this is from in-game.

1. Open up your desired version of Minecraft.
2. Go into "Options" and then "Resource Packs"
3. Click "Open Pack Folder"

#### Download the pack

The easiest way to do this is to clone the repo, if you have Git installed. Open a terminal or commandline in your resourcepacks folder and clone:

    git clone https://github.com/Xetheon/mc-fancy-doors "Fancy Doors"
    
If you're using a Minecraft version prior to 1.13, clone this branch instead:

    git clone https://github.com/Xetheon/mc-fancy-doors -b "1.12.2--1.9" "Fancy Doors"

This will also keep the pack up do date automatically. Alternatively, you can download the pack manually by going to any of its release pages.
